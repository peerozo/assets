### Already studies have pressurized you! Why let other problems come near?
Student life is the most difficult, coming out of the protective shell of parents to a new city. The competition and above all the poor facilities, half of the year goes in vain due to homesickness. At this stage, the environment matters the most, good health matters the most to flourish in studies. Do give a read further if you have faced any of the problems listed.

### *Common troubles in hostel life*

> Bad quality, unhygienic or tasteless food.
> Frequent complications with the property owner.
> Room cleanliness and maintenance issues of furniture.
> Security not provided
> Complaints registered aren’t taken into account.
> High Prices

How about we solve all your problems, eradicating the hostel system with a new digital and centralized solution? 

### Comfort living spaces are waiting for you!
Students in most developed countries who go out for studies do not opt for hostels, they go for a more luxury option because they do not deserve the hassle full of environment. Indian students also have in fact far more academic pressure and competition, why add up to their difficulties?

### Luxury facilities at a non-luxury price?
